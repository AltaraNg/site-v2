                                It has come to our attention that certain unscrupulous individuals are falsely claiming to represent or be affiliated
                                with Altara Credit Ltd. These impostors have been unlawfully appropriating elements of our brand identity and
                                operating a fraudulent loan application to deceive unsuspecting members of the public.
